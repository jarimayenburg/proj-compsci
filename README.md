## Prerequisites

What you will need to install in order to run the code:

### Python 3 libraries

```
libs
```

## Built With

* sick programma

## Implementation

The wildfire will be simulated with CAs.

### States
Every cell in the CA represents a piece of landscape of 100 meters.

Cell states:
0. Can't burn (e.g. water)
1. Can burn (e.g. trees)
2. Is burning
