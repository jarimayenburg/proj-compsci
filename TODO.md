Todo:
- CA evolution rule
    - basic buring probability done for flat terain with no wind

x Initial state input reader
    x Input files contain NxM digits representing cell states (0 - 3)
    x Reader should read this file and build a CA with initial cell states
- Visualization (Is this not done?)
    - The CA library probably has this

- wind
    - perhaps for now it is easier to have a global wind direction and speed

- Automatic landscape generation
    - perhaps this can be generated with what fractions of the landscape have
        no vegitaion, or are forest, farmland etc
    - also need to research how to represent mountains and other terain features in our grid.

Nice to haves:
- Sparks flying through the air and causing random fires (in the direction of the wind)
