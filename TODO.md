Todo:
- CA evolution rule
- Initial state input reader
    - Input files contain NxM digits representing cell states (0 - 3)
    - Reader should read this file and build a CA with initial cell states
- Visualization
    - The CA library probably has this

Nice to haves:
- Automatic landscape generation
- Sparks flying through the air and causing random fires (in the direction of the wind)
